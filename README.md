Rails API Backend

For my Mod 4 project, I created a Rails API backend with a Javascript frontend (https://github.com/Cmajewski/herd-review-frontend.git). 

My project is called Herd, and is a place where women can go to review health and wellness products with their own personal stories.  The women's health and wellness industry is flooded with expensive products, many of which are hard to distinguish between. Herd allows women to add a product and then add a review for that product. It also allows them to up-vote and down-vote to see top products at that time.
